# code-switch-analyzer
A python code to analyze code-switching data

The script includes a function that reads textual data and outputs languge use percetage and plots. 
A downloadable .csv file is also available â€“if desired.

Even if the code is easy to use, it requires some coding knowledge. 
The user must be able to create strings (e.g 'this is a string') and call functions (e.g this_function(calls_this_input)).
The whole project is based on a singel function that creates everything else.

Who is this for?
-----------
- Researchers on linguistics and NLP focused on code-switching tasks
- General linguistics researchers

Benefits
-----------
- Easy to use and implement
- Pipelines the phrase analysis by automatizing monotonic processes such as data classification and plot making

Limitations
-----------
- Code not ready for general purposes:
  1. Needs more dictionary
  2. Needs to improvements to analyze full datasets
- Only ready for Spanish and English code-switches
